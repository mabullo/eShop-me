== Description ==

Plugin for the rapid administration of the eshop's product.

The plugin creates an admin page to change quickly the costs and the other options for items on sale.
Very useful for those who have many products for sale.
Without opening each item and modify it, with this plugin you keep an eye on all products..
Shows only the categories that have items inside and eliminating the hierarchy (so you do not have duplicate elements);
clicking on a category displays all its products.
